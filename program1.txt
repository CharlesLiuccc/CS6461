example for program one
//input 20 numbers into memory
LOOP
	LDR address to R0
	IN to R1
	STR R1 to address
	AIR R0
20 times
// PRT 20 numbers

IN number to R0
STR R0

//do the subtractions and store the results
LOOP
	LDR address to R1
	LDR R0
	SMR R0 and mem[address]
	STR R0
	AIR R1
20 times

// use CMP Instruction to get the smallest one and find the original number
// we need to process the negative subtraction result
// how to find the original number is also a problem
