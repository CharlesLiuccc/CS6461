The first problem is to load ipl.txt

The second problem is about instructions in test program:
our project will start to execute the program in ipl at the address of 6 in memory
so the test program will be changed to
0006 844B
0007 0D40
0008 0E41
0009 0F42
000A 0000
000B 0064

And we try to decode the first instruction in test program:
hex:8445 equals
binary:100001 00 01 0 00101
whose opcode is 100001(binary) equals 33(digital)
We don't realize the Instruction with opcode 33(digital)
But we guess this instruction means load the content in memory[00101] to Index Register 1
Our opcode for LDX is 41(digital) equals 101001
so the test program will be changed to 
0006 A44B
0007 0D40
0008 0E41
0009 0F42
000A 0000
000B 0064
